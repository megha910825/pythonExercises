# Problem 11: University Admission Criteria
# Scenario: A university has different admission criteria based on the student's grades and extracurricular activities:

# If the student has a grade of 'A':
# If they have participated in extracurricular activities, print "Eligible for scholarship".
# If they have not participated, print "Admitted without scholarship".
# If the student has a grade of 'B':
# If they have participated in extracurricular activities, print "Admitted with standard fee".
# If they have not participated, print "Considered for waitlist".
# If the student has a grade lower than 'B', print "Application not considered".
# Task: Write a program that takes the studentâ€™s grade and participation status as input and prints the admission decision.
