1. Tuples - User Profile Storage (Easy)
Create a tuple to store a user’s profile information: (username, age, city). Then, retrieve and print each element in the tuple.
Example: For a tuple user_profile = ("Alex", 30, "Mumbai"), print each element separately.
2. List - Task Manager (Easy)
You are building a simple task manager. Create a list called tasks that stores tasks as strings. Add three tasks to the list and then remove one. Finally, display the remaining tasks.
Example: Add "Email client", "Review report", "Complete project" to tasks, remove "Review report," and display the list.
3. Dictionary - Grocery Price Lookup (Easy)
Use a dictionary to store grocery items and their prices (e.g., {"Apples": 100, "Milk": 50, "Bread": 30}). Ask the user to input an item name, and then return the price of that item.
Example: If a user inputs "Milk", display 50.
4. Set - Unique Student List (Easy)
Create a set called students that stores names of students who have submitted their assignments. Add a few names to the set, including duplicates, and print the final list of unique students.
Example: Add "John", "Alice", "Bob", "Alice" to the set and display {"John", "Alice", "Bob"}.
5. List & Dictionary - Student Grades (Medium)
Store the names of students and their grades using a dictionary (e.g., {"Alice": [88, 92, 79], "Bob": [78, 85, 88]}). Calculate and print the average grade for each student.
Example: For {"Alice": [88, 92, 79], "Bob": [78, 85, 88]}, output: Alice: 86.33, Bob: 83.67.
6. Set - Removing Duplicates in a Survey (Medium)
In a survey, some email addresses were collected multiple times. Use a set to remove duplicate email addresses and display a unique list of all emails.
Example: From a list emails = ["test@example.com", "admin@example.com", "test@example.com"], output {"test@example.com", "admin@example.com"}.
7. Dictionary - Library Book Collection (Medium)
Create a dictionary representing a library’s book collection, where keys are book titles and values are the number of copies available. Prompt the user to borrow a book, decrease the count by 1 if available, and display the updated collection.
Example: For {"Harry Potter": 3, "Python Basics": 2}, if a user borrows "Harry Potter", update to {"Harry Potter": 2, "Python Basics": 2}.
8. List - Shopping Cart (Easy to Medium)
You are building a shopping cart. Create a list of items in the cart and a corresponding list of prices. Calculate the total cost of all items in the cart and display it.
Example: For items ["Shoes", "Hat", "Shirt"] and prices [500, 150, 300], display Total: 950.
9. Tuples & Dictionary - Employee Records (Medium)
Create a dictionary where each employee ID maps to a tuple containing employee details like (name, age, position). Then, allow the user to input an ID to retrieve and display the details of that employee.
Example: For {"101": ("Alice", 30, "Manager"), "102": ("Bob", 25, "Engineer")}, if the user inputs "101", display ("Alice", 30, "Manager").
10. Set & Dictionary - Online Course Students (Medium)
Suppose you are managing student enrollments for two different online courses. Use sets to store the enrolled students' IDs for each course. Display the IDs of students who are enrolled in both courses (intersection of sets).
Example: For course_A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and course_B = {3, 4, 5, 6}, display Students in both courses: {3, 4}.
