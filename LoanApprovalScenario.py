# Problem 3: Eligibility for Loan Approval Scenario:

# A bank wants to automate loan eligibility checks.
# If a personâ€™s credit score is above 750 and their annual income is greater than 500,000, they are eligible for a loan.
# If their credit score is between 600 and 750 and income is between 300,000 and 500,000, they need a guarantor.
# If their credit score is less than 600, they are not eligible for a loan.

# Task: Write a program that takes credit score and annual income as input and prints the eligibility status.

     else:
