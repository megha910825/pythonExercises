# Calculate and print the average grade for each student.
# Example: For {"Alice": [88, 92, 79], "Bob": [78, 85, 88]}, output: Alice: 86.33, Bob: 83.67.

for key in student_grades.keys():
    average = 0

# 6. Set - Removing Duplicates in a Survey (Medium)
# In a survey, some email addresses were collected multiple times. Use a set to remove 
# duplicate email addresses and display a unique list of all emails.
# Example: From a list emails = ["test@example.com", "admin@example.com", "test@example.com"], 
# output {"test@example.com", "admin@example.com"}.

emails=["test@example.com", "admin@example.com", "test@example.com"]

print(out_emails)

# 7. Dictionary - Library Book Collection (Medium)
# Create a dictionary representing a libraryâ€™s book collection, where keys are book titles and 
# values are the number of copies available. Prompt the user to borrow a book, decrease the count 
# by 1 if available, and display the updated collection.
# Example: For {"Harry Potter": 3, "Python Basics": 2}, if a user borrows "Harry Potter", update to 
# {"Harry Potter": 2, "Python Basics": 2}.


book_collection={"Harry Potter": 3, "Python Basics": 2}
user_input=input("Enter the book you want to borrow::")

   if key==user_input:
      book_collection[key]=book_collection[key]-1
      print(book_collection)

# 8. List - Shopping Cart (Easy to Medium)
# You are building a shopping cart. Create a list of items in the cart and a corresponding list of prices.

items=["Shoes", "Hat", "Shirt"]
prices= [500, 150, 300]
total=0
for key2 in prices:
    total= total+key2
